* Tutorial Demonstration
** Include a navigation of some sort (sidebar?) displaying all of the sections, and highlight the active section
*** Make it possible to jump around sections by clicking on them
** Gamification

** If possible, display a progress bar for each section
*** Maybe for both completed problems and review problems
