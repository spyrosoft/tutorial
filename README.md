# JavaScript Tutorial Library

The goal of this library is to provide an abstract solution for creating browser tutorials.

It is designed for prompt and response flash card style, but can be used in other ways if needed.

The focus is on problems the user has answered incorrectly and has not attempted yet.

Tutorials are split into sections.

## Installation

Insert the following anywhere before your own code is loaded:
```html
<script src="tutorial.js"></script>
```
