# Installation

This repository is a demonstration of the Tutorial library in action. To create your own, all you need is the tutorial.js file.

# Overview

The goal of this library is to provide an abstract solution for creating browser tutorials.

It is designed for prompt and response (flash card style) and can be used in other ways when needed.

Problems which the user has answered incorrectly appear more often mixed in with the problems not yet attempted.

Tutorials can be split into different sections. Each section has an introduction field.
