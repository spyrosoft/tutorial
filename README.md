# JavaScript Tutorial Library

The goal of this library is to provide an abstract, helpful solution for creating tutorials in the browser.

In particular it is designed for prompt and response tutorials flash card style, but can be used in other ways if needed. There is a focus on problems the user has answered incorrectly and problems the user has not attempted yet.

Tutorials are broken up into sections.

## Installation

At the moment, jQuery is a dependency. Plop a <script src="tutorial.js"></script> anywhere after jQuery is included, and you're all set.
